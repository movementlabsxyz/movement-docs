# Contributing to Movement Documentation

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Movement Docs as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Contribution Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Make your changes and test them thoroughly. Especially if you are adding a tutorial, make sure it is complete and works as expected.
5. Commit your changes using descriptive commit messages in the present tense:
   - ✅ Good: "Add tutorial for pump fun contract"
   - ✅ Good: "Fix navigation bug in sidebar"
   - ❌ Bad: "Added new stuff"
   - ❌ Bad: "Fixed bug"

6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the original repository.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR description clearly describes the problem and solution or additional information regarding the content you are adding.
2. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
3. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed.
4. Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers, who may request changes.
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    - 📚 `:books:` when writing docs
    - 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    - ✨ `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
    - 🔨 `:hammer:` when fixing or improving existing features
    - 🎨 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code

## Any Questions?

- Feel free to open an issue for discussion
