# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about working with Movement as a developer.

## What is Movement Labs?

Movement Labs makes the Move programming language accessible across the entire modular blockchain ecosystem. By bringing the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM) to Ethereum through its innovative MEVM (Move + EVM) Layer 2, Movement Labs is creating a secure, scalable, developer-friendly blockchain infrastructure combining the best aspects of modular and monolithic architectures.

## Is Mainnet/Testnet/Devnet live?

Currently we are live on testnet and the latest information on networks can be found [here](/developers/networkEndpoints). 

## Why are there three different endpoints for each language?

The Movement Network is a single L2 built with different environments. During our devnet and testnetwork phases these are currently on seperate networks but as we continue building towards mainnet and beyond we plan to consolidate these to a single network.

## How do I get started building?

Our [getting started](/developers/getstarted) guide will help you through finding exactly what you need in order to start building on movement. 

## How can I get help?
