# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about working with Movement as a developer.

## What is Movement Labs?

Movement Labs makes the Move programming language accessible across the entire modular blockchain ecosystem. By bringing the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM) to Ethereum through its innovative MEVM (Move + EVM) Layer 2, Movement Labs is creating a secure, scalable, developer-friendly blockchain infrastructure combining the best aspects of modular and monolithic architectures.

## Is Mainnet/Testnet/Devnet live?

Currently we are live on testnet and the latest information on networks can be found [here](/docs/devs/networkEndpoints.md).

## Why are there three different endpoints for each language?

The Movement Network is a single L2 built with different environments. During our devnet and testnet phases these are currently on separate networks but as we continue building towards mainnet and beyond we plan to consolidate these into a single network.

## How do I get started building?

Our [getting started](/docs/devs/getstarted.md) guide will help you through finding exactly what you need in order to start building on Movement.

## How can I get help?

Make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/movementlabsxyz) and get yourself a developer role. You can ask any questions you have in dev-chat where someone in the community or our Developer Relations team will be able to answer your questions.

## What are the hardware requirements for running a node?

For running a Movement follower node, we recommend:
- CPU: 16 cores
- RAM: 64GB
- Storage: 4TB NVMe SSD
- Network: 2.5Gbps

However, minimum requirements are 8 cores, 32GB RAM, and 2TB storage.

## What programming languages are supported on Movement?

Movement supports multiple programming languages:
- Move language for native Move development
- Solidity for EVM compatibility
- Any language that can compile to EVM bytecode

## How does Movement ensure security?

Movement implements multiple security measures:
- Secure Move VM implementation
- Regular security audits
- Battle-tested EVM compatibility layer
- Strong consensus mechanism
- Robust validator network

## What tools are available for developers?

Movement provides a comprehensive suite of developer tools:
- Movement CLI
- SDK support for multiple languages
- Development frameworks
- Testing environments
- Block explorers
