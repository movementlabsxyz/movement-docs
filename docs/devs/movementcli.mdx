# Movement CLI

Movement CLI supports Aptos Move natively. Here are the instructions to install and use `movement` CLI.

## Prerequisites

### Install Rust and Cargo
Having Rust and Cargo is a prerequisite to installing the `movement` CLI.
The easiest way to get Cargo is to install the current stable release of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/). Installing Rust using rustup will also install `cargo`.

On Linux and macOS systems, this is done as follows:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

## Install Movement CLI (MacOS / Linux)

:::tip

When developing on Movement, it is recommended to use the `movement` CLI.

:::

### Binary Install
```
git clone https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/ && cd aptos-core
```
```
cargo build -p movement
```

Copy `movement` into your `bin` or add it to your `PATH` depending on your system config.

For example, to copy `movement` to `bin` on Mac or Linux:

```
sudo cp target/debug/movement /usr/local/bin/
```


## Use Movement CLI

Movement CLI commands are analogous to those of Aptos CLI. Simply replace `aptos` with `movement`.

So `aptos move build` becomes `movement move build`.

For help within the CLI tool:

```
movement --help
```

or

```
movement <subcommand> --help
```

Developers who would like to contribute or read the source code, please see [the Movement CLI crate](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/tree/movement/crates/aptos).
