# Movement CLI

Movement CLI supports Aptos Move natively. Here are the instructions to install and use `movement` CLI.

## Prerequisites

### Install Rust and Cargo
Having Rust and Cargo is a prerequisite to installing the `movement` CLI.
The easiest way to get Cargo is to install the current stable release of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/). Installing Rust using rustup will also install `cargo`.

On Linux and macOS systems, this is done as follows:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
## Quick Install Movement Precompiled Binaries

  <TabItem value="MacOS ARM" label="MacOS ARM" default>
    This installation script is for newer Macs with the Apple Silicon processor.

    ``` bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/homebrew-movement-cli/releases/download/bypass-homebrew/movement-macos-arm64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf movement-macos-arm64.tar.gz
    chmod +x macos-arm64/movement
    sudo mv macos-arm64/movement /usr/local/bin/movement
    ```

  <TabItem value="MacOS Intel" label="MacOS Intel">
    This installation script is for older Macs with the Intel processor.

    ``` bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/homebrew-movement-cli/releases/download/bypass-homebrew/movement-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf movement-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
    chmod +x macos-x86_64/movement
    sudo mv macos-x86_64/movement /usr/local/bin/movement
    ```


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">
    This installation script uses Aptos CLI at version 3.5.0. When using the Aptos CLI replace all movement move commands with aptos move commands. This has been tested with Powershell.

    ```bash
    $Version = "3.5.0"
    $ZipUrl = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases/download/aptos-cli-v$Version/aptos-cli-$Version-Windows-x86_64.zip"
    $InstallDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\.aptoscli\bin"
    $ZipPath = "$env:TEMP\aptos-cli.zip"

    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $ZipUrl -OutFile $ZipPath
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $InstallDir | Out-Null
    Expand-Archive -Path $ZipPath -DestinationPath $InstallDir -Force

    # Set PATH
    $CurrentPath = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
    if ($CurrentPath -notlike "*$InstallDir*") {
    setx PATH "$CurrentPath;$InstallDir"
    Write-Host "`n✅ PATH updated. Please restart your terminal before running 'aptos'."
    } else {
    Write-Host "`n✅ PATH already configured."
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install Movement CLI Manually

:::tip

When developing on Movement, it is recommended to use the `movement` CLI.

:::

### Binary Install
```
git clone https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/ && cd aptos-core
```
```
cargo build -p movement
```

Copy `movement` into your `bin` or add it to your `PATH` depending on your system config.

For example, to copy `movement` to `bin` on Mac or Linux:

```
sudo cp target/debug/movement /usr/local/bin/
```


## Use Movement CLI

Movement CLI commands are analogous to those of Aptos CLI. Simply replace `aptos` with `movement`.

So `aptos move build` becomes `movement move build`.

For help within the CLI tool:

```
movement --help
```

or

```
movement <subcommand> --help
```

Developers who would like to contribute or read the source code, please see [the Movement CLI crate](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/tree/movement/crates/aptos).
