# Aptos Python SDK

Aptos provides a lightly maintained official Python SDK. It is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/aptos-sdk/) with the source code in the [aptos-python-sdk GitHub repository](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-python-sdk). Much of the functionality of the Python SDK mirrors the Typescript SDK. The primary purpose of the Python SDK is to help Python developers to quickly become familiar with Aptos and as an accompaniment to Aptos tutorials.

## Installation

### Install with pip 

```bash
pip3 install aptos-sdk
```

### Install from source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-python-sdk
pip3 install . --user
```

### Install by embedding

cd /path/to/python/project
cp -r /path/to/aptos-python-sdk aptos-sdk
```

## Usage

```python
from aptos_sdk import AptosClient
