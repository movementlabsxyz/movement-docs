# Templates and Docs

Below you can find a list of templates and documentations for Wallet SDKs from many of our partnered wallets. In some cases you will have full templates for you to start from that can auto detect any Aptos Wallets, in other cases you will have documentation for you to implement their specific SDK into your dApp.
