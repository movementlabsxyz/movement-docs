# Wallet Connection

This component demonstrates how to implement wallet connection functionality using the Aptos Wallet Adapter in a React application. It provides a simple interface for users to connect and disconnect their Aptos wallet.

## Prerequisites

- `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` package installed
- A React application setup

## Implementation

The `WalletConnectDemo` component uses the `useWallet` hook from the Aptos Wallet Adapter to manage wallet connections. Here's how to implement it:

1️⃣ First, import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript
import { WalletName, useWallet } from '@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react';
```

2️⃣ The component uses these key features from the `useWallet` hook:
- `connect`: Function to establish a connection with the wallet
- `disconnect`: Function to terminate the wallet connection
- `account`: Contains the connected account information
- `connected`: Boolean state indicating if a wallet is connected

3️⃣ Key Functions:

```typescript
// Connect to wallet
const handleConnect = async () => {
  try {
    await connect("Petra" as WalletName<"Petra">);
    // You can replace "Petra" with any supported wallet name
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to wallet:', error);
  }
};

// Disconnect from wallet
const handleDisconnect = async () => {
  try {
    await disconnect();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to disconnect from wallet:', error);
  }
};
```

## Usage

The component renders a simple UI that shows:
- A "Connect Wallet" button when no wallet is connected
- The connected wallet address and a "Disconnect" button when a wallet is connected

To use this component in your application:

```typescript
import WalletConnectDemo from './components/WalletConnect';

// In your React component:
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <WalletConnectDemo />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Important Notes

1️⃣ Make sure your app is wrapped with the Aptos Wallet Provider:
```typescript
import { AptosWalletAdapterProvider } from '@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <AptosWalletAdapterProvider>
      <WalletConnectDemo />
    </AptosWalletAdapterProvider>
  );
}
```

2️⃣ You can modify the wallet name in `handleConnect` to connect to different wallets:
   - "Petra"
   - "Martian"
   - "Pontem"
   - Other supported Aptos wallets

3️⃣ Error handling is implemented for both connection and disconnection operations to provide a better user experience.

## Example Response

When connected, the component will display the wallet address and a disconnect button. The address will be in the format:
```
Connected to: 0x123...abc
```

## FullCode
```typescript title="src/components/WalletConnect.tsx"
import React from 'react';
import { WalletName, useWallet } from '@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react';

const WalletConnectButton = () => {
  const { connect, disconnect, account, connected } = useWallet();

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    try {
      // Change below to the desired wallet name instead of "Petra"
      await connect("Petra" as WalletName<"Petra">);
      console.log('Connected to wallet:', account);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to connect to wallet:', error);
    }
  };

  const handleDisconnect = async () => {
    try {
      await disconnect();
      console.log('Disconnected from wallet');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to disconnect from wallet:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Aptos Wallet Connection</h1>
      <div>
        {connected ? (
          <div>
            <p>Connected to: {account?.address}</p>
            <button onClick={handleDisconnect}>Disconnect</button>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect Wallet</button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default WalletConnectButton;
```
