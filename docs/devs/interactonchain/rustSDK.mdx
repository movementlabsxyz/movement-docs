# Aptos Rust SDK

Aptos provides an official lightly supported Rust SDK in the Aptos-core GitHub repository. To use the Rust SDK, add the following dependency and patches on the git repo directly in your Cargo.toml, like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
aptos-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core", branch = "devnet" }
 
[patch.crates-io]
merlin = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/merlin" }
x25519-dalek = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/x25519-dalek", branch = "zeroize_v1" }
```

You must also create a `.cargo/config.toml` file with this content:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["--cfg", "tokio_unstable"]
```

## Usage

Full example availables [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs).

Network endpoints should be replaced with the appropriate [Movement endpoints](/devs/networkEndpoints).
