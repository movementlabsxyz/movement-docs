               ### Option 1: Using Foundryup
               - Foundryup is the official installer for the [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
               - To install Foundryup, open your terminal and run the following command:
               ```bash title="Terminal"
               curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
               ```
               :::note
               If you’re using Windows, you’ll need to install and use Git BASH or WSL as your terminal, since Foundryup currently doesn’t support Powershell or Command Prompt (Cmd).
               :::
               ### Option 2: Building from Source
               :::info
               - Prerequisites
                  - Install [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

               - Step 1: Building
                   > You can either use the various flags provided by Foundryup:
                   ```bash title="Terminal"
                   foundryup --branch master
                   foundryup --path path/to/foundry
                   ```

                   Or, you can install via Cargo with the following command: (Recommendation)
                   ```bash title="Terminal"
                   cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --profile release --locked forge cast chisel anvil

                   ### CI Installation with GitHub Actions
                     > For instructions on setting up Foundry in a CI pipeline, refer to the foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain [GitHub Action](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain).
                   ### Using Foundry with Docker
                     > Foundry can also be run inside a Docker container. If you don’t have Docker installed, you can download it from [Docker’s website](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
                   - Once Docker is installed, you can pull the latest Foundry release by running:
                   ```bash title="Terminal"
                   docker pull ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest
                   ```
                   - You can also build the Docker image locally by running the following command from the Foundry repository:
                   ```bash title="Terminal"
                   docker build -t foundry .
                   ```
                   :::note
                   Some systems, including those with M1 chips, may experience issues when building the Docker image locally. This is a known issue.
