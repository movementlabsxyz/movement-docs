# What is the Movement Network?

Movement Labs is building a network of Move-based blockchains. Our flagship products are the Movement Network and the M1 shared sequencer. 

Movement is a community-first blockchain providing the highest possible TPS through Move, instant finality, native day-zero access to mass liquidity, and modular customizations.

It will support Aptos Move, Sui Move, and also our embedded EVM interpreter MEVMâ€”empowering both Sui, Aptos, and EVM users to use the L2.

## Why Move?

Move is a safe and secure programming language designed by Facebook for smart contracts that emphasizes ownership and safety. Assets in Move are represented as resources. Owing to Move's strong ownership model and explicit resource abilities, Move simplifies the development of safe smart contracts for common blockchain tasks such as transfer ownership of assets, minting, and destroying. 

The chart below compares common non-Move runtimes against Aptos and Sui Move runtimes, underscoring the different models and benefits of Move.
