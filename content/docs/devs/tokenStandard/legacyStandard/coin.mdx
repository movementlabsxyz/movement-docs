# Coin (Legacy Standard)

The legacy Coin standard is a basic fungible token format used by the core chain and early applications on Movement Network. While functional, it has been superseded by the more powerful Fungible Asset (FA) standard, which offers richer functionality and better developer experience.

## Overview

The Coin standard provides a simple, straightforward way to create fungible tokens. It's implemented in the core Move modules and has been the foundation for many early tokens on Movement Network, including the native gas token.
