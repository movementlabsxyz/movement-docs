# Fungible Asset (FA) Standard

The Fungible Asset (FA) Standard is a full-featured way to represent fungible tokens on Movement Network. It's designed to replace the simple Coin system with richer, object-based fungible assets that support fractional ownership, automatic storage creation, and better control over token behavior.

## Overview

The FA standard provides a modern, type-safe, and efficient token logic framework that goes beyond basic fungible token functionality. It's built on the Move Object Model, offering developers more expressiveness and flexibility for diverse use cases — from currencies to in-game assets.

## Key Features

### Type-Safe Token Logic

The FA standard ensures:
- **Compile-time Safety** — Catch errors before deployment
- **Strong Typing** — Prevent token mixing and confusion
- **Guaranteed Correctness** — Mathematical operations are verified
- **Resource Safety** — Tokens cannot be duplicated or destroyed improperly

### Automatic Storage Creation

Unlike legacy systems, FA automatically handles:
- **Recipient Account Setup** — No manual opt-in required
- **Storage Allocation** — Automatic balance tracking
- **Initialization** — Seamless first-time receives
- **Gas Optimization** — Efficient storage patterns

### Enhanced Control

Developers have fine-grained control over:
- **Minting** — Create new tokens with custom rules
- **Burning** — Destroy tokens permanently
- **Transfers** — Implement custom transfer logic
- **Permissions** — Role-based access control
- **Freezing** — Temporarily lock tokens
- **Pausing** — Emergency stop mechanisms

## Design Principles

### Efficiency

- Optimized storage patterns
- Minimal gas consumption
- Batch operation support
- Efficient balance queries

### Flexibility

- Customizable token behaviors
- Extensible metadata
- Plugin architecture
- Upgradeable logic

### Security

- Built-in safety checks
- Overflow protection
- Access control primitives
- Audit-friendly code structure

## Why FA Replaces Coin

The Fungible Asset standard improves upon the legacy Coin standard in several ways:

### Richer Functionality

| Feature | Coin | Fungible Asset |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Basic transfers | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom transfer logic | ❌ | ✅ |
| Automatic storage | ❌ | ✅ |
| Fractional ownership | Limited | ✅ |
| Metadata support | Basic | Rich |
| Extensibility | Limited | High |
| Role-based permissions | ❌ | ✅ |

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### Asset Metadata
```
- Name
- Symbol
- Decimals
- Icon URI
- Project URI
```

#### Supply Management
- Total supply tracking
- Maximum supply limits
- Minting capabilities
- Burning mechanisms

#### Balance Tracking
- Per-account balances
- Efficient queries
- Atomic updates
- Event emissions

### Operations

#### Minting
Create new tokens with:

- Burn event emission

## Implementation Guide

### Creating a Fungible Asset

1. **Define Metadata** — Set name, symbol, decimals
2. **Configure Supply** — Set max supply and minting rules
3. **Set Permissions** — Define who can mint/burn
4. **Deploy Contract** — Publish to Movement Network
5. **Initialize** — Set up initial state
6. **Test Thoroughly** — Verify all operations

### Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Decimals** — Match your use case (e.g., 6-8 for currencies)
2. **Implement Access Controls** — Secure privileged operations
3. **Emit Events** — Enable tracking and indexing
4. **Document Behavior** — Clear documentation for users
5. **Test Edge Cases** — Verify overflow, underflow, zero amounts
6. **Consider Upgradeability** — Plan for future enhancements
7. **Audit Security** — Professional review before mainnet

### Integration Patterns

#### Wallet Integration
- Standard balance queries
- Transfer interfaces
- Approval mechanisms
- Event subscriptions

#### DApp Integration
- Token discovery
- Balance display
- Transaction building
- Status monitoring

#### Exchange Integration
- Deposit handling
- Withdrawal processing
- Balance reconciliation
- Transaction confirmation

## Migration from Coin

If you're migrating from the legacy Coin standard:

### Assessment Phase
1. **Inventory Current Usage** — List all Coin implementations
2. **Identify Dependencies** — Find contracts using your Coin
3. **Plan Migration Path** — Determine migration strategy
4. **Estimate Timeline** — Set realistic migration schedule

### Migration Steps
1. **Deploy FA Contract** — Create new FA version
2. **Set Up Bridge** — Enable Coin ↔ FA conversion
3. **Migrate Balances** — Transfer user balances
4. **Update Integrations** — Modify dependent contracts
5. **Test Thoroughly** — Verify all functionality
6. **Communicate** — Inform users and partners
7. **Monitor** — Track migration progress
8. **Deprecate Coin** — Phase out old standard

### Compatibility Considerations
- Maintain parallel support during transition
