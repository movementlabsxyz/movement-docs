# Token Standard

The token standard is a standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across DApps, wallets, and RPC solutions across Movement Network.

## What Are Standards?

Standards are shared blueprints that define how important features — like tokens, wallets, and on-chain objects — should behave. They make sure contracts from different developers work together smoothly: assets look the same, interact predictably, and are supported by wallets and marketplaces.

Movement Standards are shared interfaces and models that every smart contract and wallet on Movement should follow to ensure interoperability and consistency. They include:

- **Move Standards** — Core object model for how data and resources are structured.
- **Asset Standards** — Formal rules for tokens and NFTs (replacing older standards).
- **Digital Asset (DA)** — Next-gen NFT standard.
- **Fungible Asset (FA)** — New model for fungible (regular) tokens.
- **Legacy Standards** — Older token/coin systems still in docs for reference.

## Object Model

Movement uses the **Move Object Model** to represent real-world things on chain. Instead of building bespoke contract layouts every time, developers use a stable object-based format. Objects encapsulate resources with strict rules about ownership, transfer, and mutation — minimizing bugs and improving composability.

**Why it matters:** Move Objects are the foundation underpinning all asset standards — both fungible and non-fungible.

## Current Standard

The current standards represent the modern approach to token and asset management on Movement:

### Digital Asset (DA) Standard

This is the modern guideline for non-fungible and semi-fungible assets.

**Highlights:**
- Tokens are stored as Move Objects
- NFTs live in collections and have rich metadata
- You can transfer NFTs without the recipient opting in first
- NFTs can own other NFTs — enabling nested and composable asset structures

**When to use:** All new NFT projects should adopt DA for flexibility and ecosystem compatibility.

### Fungible Asset (FA) Standard

A full-featured way to represent fungible tokens.

**Design Principles:**
- Type-safe and efficient token logic
- Automatic creation of recipient storage
- Better control over minting, burning, transfers, and permissions

**Why it replaces Coin:** FA is more expressive and flexible for diverse use cases — from currencies to in-game assets.

## Legacy Standard

Even though new standards are recommended, older ones continue to exist for backwards compatibility:

- **Token** — Combines NFTs, fungibles, and semi-fungibles with customizable on-chain properties
- **Coin** — A simple fungible token format used by the core chain and early applications

These remain supported for compatibility while the ecosystem transitions to DA/FA.
