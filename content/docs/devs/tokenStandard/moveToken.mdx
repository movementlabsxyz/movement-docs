# MOVE Token

MOVE is the native token of the Movement Network, serving as the fundamental unit of value and utility across the entire ecosystem. It powers transactions, secures the network, and enables governance participation.

## Overview

The MOVE token is implemented using the Fungible Asset (FA) standard, representing the modern approach to token design on Movement Network. As the native asset, MOVE plays a critical role in network operations, economic incentives, and ecosystem growth.

## Token Utility

### Gas Fees

MOVE is used to pay for transaction fees on the network:
- **Transaction Execution** — Pay for computational resources

- **Smart Contract Deployment** — Deploy and interact with contracts
- **Network Operations** — All on-chain activities

### Network Security

MOVE secures the Movement Network through staking:
- **Validator Staking** — Validators stake MOVE to participate in consensus
- **Delegated Staking** — Token holders delegate to validators
- **Slashing Protection** — Economic security through stake
- **Reward Distribution** — Validators and delegators earn rewards

### Governance

MOVE holders participate in network governance:
- **Proposal Voting** — Vote on protocol upgrades
