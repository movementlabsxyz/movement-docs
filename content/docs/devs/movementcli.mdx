Movement CLI supports Aptos Move natively. Here are the instructions to install and use `movement` CLI.

## Prerequisites

### Install Rust and Cargo
Having Rust and Cargo is a prerequisite to installing the `movement` CLI.
The easiest way to get Cargo is to install the current stable release of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/). Installing Rust using rustup will also install `cargo`.

On Linux and macOS systems, this is done as follows:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

## Quick Install Movement Precompiled Binaries

```bash tab="MacOS ARM"
curl -LO https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/homebrew-movement-cli/releases/download/bypass-homebrew/movement-macos-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf movement-macos-arm64.tar.gz
chmod +x macos-arm64/movement
sudo mv macos-arm64/movement /usr/local/bin/movement
```

```bash tab="MacOS Intel"
curl -LO https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/homebrew-movement-cli/releases/download/bypass-homebrew/movement-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf movement-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
chmod +x macos-x86_64/movement
sudo mv macos-x86_64/movement /usr/local/bin/movement
```

```bash tab="Windows"
$Version = "3.5.0"
$ZipUrl = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases/download/aptos-cli-v$Version/aptos-cli-$Version-Windows-x86_64.zip"
$InstallDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\.aptoscli\bin"
$ZipPath = "$env:TEMP\aptos-cli.zip"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $ZipUrl -OutFile $ZipPath
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $InstallDir | Out-Null
Expand-Archive -Path $ZipPath -DestinationPath $InstallDir -Force

# Set PATH
$CurrentPath = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
if ($CurrentPath -notlike "*$InstallDir*") {
setx PATH "$CurrentPath;$InstallDir"
Write-Host "`n✅ PATH updated. Please restart your terminal before running 'aptos'."
} else {
Write-Host "`n✅ PATH already configured."
}
```

## Install Movement CLI Manually

<Callout type="info">

When developing on Movement, it is recommended to use the `movement` CLI.

</Callout>

### Binary Install
```
git clone https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/ && cd aptos-core
```
```
cargo build -p movement
```

Copy `movement` into your `bin` or add it to your `PATH` depending on your system config.

For example, to copy `movement` to `bin` on Mac or Linux:

```
sudo cp target/debug/movement /usr/local/bin/
```


## Use Movement CLI

Movement CLI commands are analogous to those of Aptos CLI. Simply replace `aptos` with `movement`.

So `aptos move build` becomes `movement move build`.

For help within the CLI tool:

```
movement --help
```

or

```
movement <subcommand> --help
```
