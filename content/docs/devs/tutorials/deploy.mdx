description: Deploy your Move module to the Movement Network
---

🚀 If you already have a Move module written, you can deploy it to the Movement Network using the Movement CLI or Aptos CLI.

For a full guide on how to install the CLI and get your development environment setup, please see our [First Move Module](/devs/firstMoveContract) guide.

## Check Config

Ensure your `config.yaml` is configured to the correct network for the profile you are using. This can be found in the `.movement` directory at the root of your project.

```
---
profiles:
  default:
    network: Custom
    private_key: "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
    public_key: "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
    account: "account_address"
    rest_url: "https://testnet.movementnetwork.xyz/v1"
    faucet_url: "https://faucet.testnet.movementnetwork.xyz/"
```


## Add Address to Move.Toml

To make compiling, testing, and of course deploying your Move module easier, you can add your address to the `move.toml` file at the root of your Move project.

```
[addresses]
default = "YOUR_ADDRESS"
```

## Deploy to Movement Network

Run the following command to deploy your Move module to the Movement Network:

```     
movement move publish
```

You'll be prompted to confirm the transaction and spend a small amount of testnet tokens:

```
Do you want to submit this transaction? [Y/n]
```

Type `Y` and press **Enter**.

> **Ensure you have sufficient testnet tokens from the faucet before proceeding.**
