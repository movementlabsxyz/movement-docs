# Tuple and Unit Types

Tuples in Move are used to support multiple return values from functions and temporary grouping of values. Move's tuple support is limited compared to other programming languages. These expressions do not result in a concrete value at runtime (there are no tuples in the bytecode), and as a result they are very limited:

- They can only appear in expressions (usually in the return position for a function).
- They cannot be bound to local variables.
- They cannot be stored in structs.
- Tuple types cannot be used to instantiate generics.

## Tuple Syntax

Tuples are created by a comma-separated list of expressions inside parentheses:

```move
// Creating tuples (compile-time only)
(10, true)
(1, 2, 3)
(@0x1, b"hello", 42u8)
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Tuples cannot be assigned to variables or stored - they can only be used in function returns and immediate destructuring.
</Callout>

## Unit Type

The unit type `()` represents "no value" and is used when a function doesn't return anything. Unit is similar to `void` in other programming languages. The following three functions are equivalent:

```move
fun do_something(): () {
    // Function body
    // Implicitly returns ()
}

// Equivalent to:
fun do_something() {
    // Function body
}
```

## Function Returns

Tuples are primarily used for returning multiple values from functions:

```move
fun get_name_and_age(): (vector<u8>, u8) {
    (b"Alice", 25)
}

fun get_coordinates(): (u64, u64) {
    (100, 200)
}

fun multiple_values(): (bool, u64, address) {
    (true, 42, @0x1)
}
```

## Destructuring

The main operation for tuples is destructuring - extracting individual values:

```move
fun example() {
    // Destructure tuple from function return
    let (name, age) = get_name_and_age();
    let (x, y) = get_coordinates();
    let (flag, number, addr) = multiple_values();
    
    // Use the extracted values
    assert!(age == 25, 0);
    assert!(x == 100, 1);
}
```

### Partial Destructuring

You can ignore values you don't need using underscore:

```move
fun partial_example() {
    let (name, _) = get_name_and_age();  // Ignore age
    let (_, y) = get_coordinates();       // Ignore x coordinate
    let (flag, _, _) = multiple_values(); // Only use the boolean
}
```

## Limitations

Tuples in Move have several important limitations:

- **No storage**: Cannot be stored in global storage or struct fields

```move
module examples::no_storage {
    struct Holder {
        field: (u64, bool)  // Error: tuple type `(u64, bool)` is not allowed as a field type
    }
}
```

- **No variables**: Cannot assign tuples to variables

```move
fun invalid_local() {
    let t: (u64, bool) = (1, true);  // Error: tuple type `(u64, bool)` is not allowed as a local variable type
}
```

- **Compile-time only**: Exist only during compilation, not at runtime

- **No operations**: Cannot perform operations on tuples directly

```move
fun invalid_operations() {
    let x = (1, 2) + (3, 4);   // Error: cannot use `(integer, integer)` with an operator which expects a value of type `integer`
}
```

- **No Nested tuple**: Cannot be nested

```move
fun no_nested_tuples() {
    let t = ((1, 2), 3);  // Error: nested tuples are not allowed
}
```

## Practical Examples

Here are common tuple usage patterns:

```move
// Swapping values using tuples
fun swap_values(x: u64, y: u64): (u64, u64) {
    (y, x)
}

// Multiple calculations
fun calculate_stats(numbers: &vector<u64>): (u64, u64, u64) {
    let sum = 0;
    let min = 0;
    let max = 0;
    // ... calculation logic ...
    (sum, min, max)
}

// Error handling pattern
fun divide_safe(a: u64, b: u64): (bool, u64) {
    if (b == 0) {
        (false, 0)  // Error case
    } else {
        (true, a / b)  // Success case
    }
}

fun use_divide() {
    let (success, result) = divide_safe(10, 2);
    if (success) {
        // Use result
    }
}
```

## Subtyping

Along with references, tuples are the only types that have subtyping in Move. Tuples have subtyping only in the sense that they are covariant with references.

This means that if you have a tuple containing references, you can use it where a tuple with less restrictive reference types is expected:

```move
let x: &u64 = &0;
let y: &mut u64 = &mut 1;

// (&u64, &mut u64) is a subtype of (&u64, &u64)
// since &mut u64 is a subtype of &u64
let (a, b): (&u64, &u64) = (x, y);

// (&mut u64, &mut u64) is a subtype of (&u64, &u64)
// since &mut u64 is a subtype of &u64
let (c, d): (&u64, &u64) = (y, y);

// Error! (&u64, &mut u64) is NOT a subtype of (&mut u64, &mut u64)
// since &u64 is NOT a subtype of &mut u64
// let (e, f): (&mut u64, &mut u64) = (x, y);
```

This subtyping relationship follows the same rules as reference subtyping:
- `&mut T` is a subtype of `&T` (you can use a mutable reference where an immutable one is expected)
- `&T` is NOT a subtype of `&mut T` (you cannot use an immutable reference where a mutable one is expected)

## Ownership

Tuples themselves don't have ownership semantics since they cannot be stored. However, the values within tuples follow normal Move ownership rules:

- Values are moved into tuples when created
- Values are moved out when destructured
- Copy types can be copied, non-copy types are moved

```move
fun ownership_example() {
    let x = 10u64;  // Copy type
    let v = vector[1, 2, 3];  // Non-copy type
    
    let (a, b) = (x, v);  // x is copied, v is moved
    // x can still be used, but v cannot
}
```

## Summary

Tuples in Move are:
- **Compile-time constructs** for grouping values temporarily
- **Used primarily** for multiple function returns
- **Destructured immediately** - cannot be stored as variables
- **Limited in scope** - no runtime existence or operations
- **Useful for** returning multiple values and swapping

The unit type `()` represents the absence of a value and is the default return type for functions that don't explicitly return anything.
