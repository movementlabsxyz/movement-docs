# Conditional

Conditionals are fundamental control flow constructs that allow programs to make decisions based on runtime values. An `if` expression specifies that some code should only be evaluated if a certain condition is true. 

## Basic If Expression

The simplest form of a conditional expression:

```move
if (temperature > 30) is_hot = true
```

The condition must be an expression of type `bool`. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the expression following the condition is executed.

## If-Else Expression

An `if` expression can optionally include an `else` clause to specify another expression to evaluate when the condition is false:

```move
if (speed <= 60) speed = speed + 5 else speed = 60
```

Either the "true" branch or the "false" branch will be evaluated, but not both. Either branch can be a single expression or an expression block.

## Conditional Expressions with Values

The conditional expressions may produce values so that the `if` expression has a result:

```move
let price = if (quantity < 10) quantity * 5 else quantity * 4;
```

This allows conditionals to be used in assignments and other expressions where a value is expected.

## Type Compatibility

The expressions in the true and false branches must have compatible types:

```move
// width and height must be u64 integers
let larger_dimension: u64 = if (width > height) width else height;
```

### Type Errors

Branches with incompatible types will result in compilation errors:

```move
// ERROR! branches different types
let result = if (is_valid < 10) 10u8 else 100u64;

// ERROR! branches different types, as default false-branch is () not u64
if (score >= 10) score;
```

## Default Else Clause

If the `else` clause is not specified, the false branch defaults to the unit value `()`. The following are equivalent:

```move
if (is_ready) start_process // implied default: else ()
if (is_ready) start_process else ()
```

This means that when no `else` clause is provided, the `if` expression returns the unit type `()` when the condition is false.

## Expression Blocks

Commonly, `if` expressions are used in conjunction with expression blocks for more complex logic:

```move
let total_cost = if (items > 5) items * 8 else items * 10;

if (total_cost < 50) {
    shipping_fee = 5;
    tax_rate = 8;
} else if (total_cost >= 50 && total_cost < 100) {
    shipping_fee = 0;
    tax_rate = 10;
}
```

## Nested Conditionals

You can chain multiple conditions using `else if`:

```move
let shipping_method = if (weight <= 1) {
    b"standard"
} else if (weight <= 5) {
    b"express"
} else if (weight <= 20) {
    b"freight"
} else {
    b"special_handling"
};
```

## Practical Examples

### Temperature Control



```move
fun adjust_temperature(current: u64, target: u64): u64 {
    if (current < target) {
        current + 2
    } else if (current > target) {
        current - 2
    } else {
        current
    }
}
```

## Complex Conditions

Conditionals can use complex boolean expressions with logical operators:

```move
fun can_access_system(role: u8, is_active: bool, has_permission: bool): bool {
    if (role >= 2 && is_active && has_permission) {
        true
    } else {
        false
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

Due to short-circuit evaluation in logical operators, structure conditions efficiently:

```move
// Efficient: check simple condition first
if (is_online && complex_validation()) {
    // process request
}

// Less efficient: complex check might run unnecessarily
if (complex_validation() && is_online) {
    // process request
}
```

## Grammar

The formal grammar for conditional expressions:

```
if-expression → if ( expression ) expression else-clause?
else-clause → else expression
```

## Best Practices

- **Use meaningful conditions** - Make boolean expressions clear and readable
- **Consistent return types** - Ensure both branches return compatible types
- **Avoid deep nesting** - Use `else if` chains instead of deeply nested conditionals
- **Structure conditions efficiently** - Put simple checks before complex ones

## Summary

Move's conditional expressions provide:
- **Decision making** based on boolean conditions
- **Value production** through if-else expressions
- **Type safety** with compile-time branch compatibility checks
- **Flexible syntax** supporting both simple and complex logic

Conditionals are essential for implementing business logic, validation, and control flow in Move programs.
