# Scripts

Scripts in Move are executable entry points similar to a `main` function in conventional programming languages.
They serve as ephemeral code snippets that orchestrate interactions with published modules and facilitate updates to global storage.

## Overview

Scripts are **not published** to global storage, making them temporary execution units that primarily invoke functions from published modules.
They provide a way to execute Move code without permanently storing it on the blockchain.

## Script Structure

A script follows a specific structural pattern that must be adhered to:

```move
script {
    <use>*
    <constants>*
    fun <identifier><[type parameters: constraint]*>([identifier: type]*) <function_body>
}
```

### Structure Requirements

The script block must follow this exact order:

1. **Use declarations** - All import statements must come first
2. **Constants** - Any constant definitions follow the imports
3. **Main function** - A single function declaration that serves as the entry point

### Main Function Characteristics

- Can have **any name** (doesn't need to be called `main`)
- Must be the **only function** in the script block
- Can accept **any number of arguments**
- **Must not return a value**

## Example

Here's a complete example demonstrating all components of a valid script:

```move
script {
    // Import
    use std::debug::print;

    // A constant
    const CONST: u8 = 0;

    // Main function (entry point)
    fun main(value: u64) {
        let result = value + (CONST as u64);
        print(&result);
    }
}
```

## What's NOT ALLOWED in Scripts

The following code demonstrates elements that are **forbidden** in scripts and would cause compilation errors:

```move
// This is INVALID in a script - for illustration only
script {
    // Imports are ALLOWED
    use std::debug::print;

    // Friend declarations are NOT ALLOWED
    friend 0x1::otherModule;

    // Struct definitions are NOT ALLOWED
    public struct Struct {}

    // Additional function definitions are NOT ALLOWED
    fun function(_: &Struct) { /* function body */ }

    // Constants are ALLOWED
    const CONST: u8 = 0;

    // Only ONE main function is ALLOWED
    fun main() {
        print(&CONST);
    }
}
```

## Limitations

Scripts have intentionally limited capabilities to maintain security and clarity:

- Cannot declare `friend` functions
- Cannot define `struct` types
- Cannot directly access global storage
- Can only invoke functions from published modules

## Use Cases

Scripts are primarily used for:

- **Transaction execution** - Orchestrating complex operations across multiple modules
- **Testing and debugging** - Running temporary code without publishing
