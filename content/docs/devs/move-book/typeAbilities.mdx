# Type Abilities

Abilities are a typing feature in Move that control what actions are permissible for values of a given type. This system grants fine-grained control over the "linear" typing behavior of values, as well as if and how values are used in global storage. This is implemented by gating access to certain bytecode instructions so that for a value to be used with the bytecode instruction, it must have the ability required (if one is required at all—not every instruction is gated by an ability).

## The Four Abilities

The four abilities are:

| Ability | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `copy` | Allows values of types with this ability to be copied |
| `drop` | Allows values of types with this ability to be popped/dropped |
| `store` | Allows values of types with this ability to exist inside a struct in global storage |
| `key` | Allows the type to serve as a key for global storage operations |

## Copy

The `copy` ability allows values of types with that ability to be copied. It gates the ability to copy values out of local variables with the `copy` operator and to copy values via references with dereference `*e`.

```move
struct Copyable has copy { value: u64 }

fun example() {
    let x = Copyable { value: 10 };
    let y = copy x;  // Valid: Copyable has 'copy'
    let z = *&x;     // Valid: dereference requires 'copy'
}
```

**Important rule**: If a value has `copy`, all values contained inside of that value have `copy`.

## Drop

The `drop` ability allows values of types with that ability to be dropped. By "dropped," we mean that value is not transferred and is effectively destroyed as the Move program executes. As such, this ability gates the ability to ignore values in a multitude of locations, including:

- Not using the value in a local variable or parameter
- Not using the value in a sequence via `;`
- Overwriting values in variables in assignments
- Overwriting values via references when writing `*e1 = e2`

```move
struct Droppable has drop { value: u64 }

fun example() {
    let x = Droppable { value: 10 };
    // Valid: x is automatically dropped at end of scope
    
    Droppable { value: 20 }; // Valid: value is ignored/dropped
    
    let mut y = Droppable { value: 30 };
    y = Droppable { value: 40 }; // Valid: old value is dropped
}
```

**Important rule**: If a value has `drop`, all values contained inside of that value have `drop`.

## Store

The `store` ability allows values of types with this ability to exist inside of a struct (resource) in global storage, but not necessarily as a top-level resource in global storage. This is the only ability that does not directly gate an operation. Instead it gates the existence in global storage when used in tandem with `key`.

```move
struct Storable has store { value: u64 }

struct Container has key {
    item: Storable  // Valid: Storable has 'store'
}
```

**Important rule**: If a value has `store`, all values contained inside of that value have `store`.

## Key

The `key` ability allows the type to serve as a key for global storage operations. It gates all global storage operations, so in order for a type to be used with `move_to`, `borrow_global`, `move_from`, etc., the type must have the `key` ability. Note that the operations still must be used in the module where the key type is defined (in a sense, the operations are private to the defining module).

```move
struct Resource has key {
    value: u64
}

public fun create_resource(account: &signer) {
    move_to(account, Resource { value: 42 }); // Valid: Resource has 'key'
}
```

**Important rule**: If a value has `key`, all values contained inside of that value have `store`. This is the only ability with this sort of asymmetry.

## Builtin Types

Most primitive, builtin types have `copy`, `drop`, and `store` with the exception of `signer`, which just has `drop`:

### Primitive Types
- `bool`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `u256`, and `address` all have `copy`, `drop`, and `store`
- `signer` has `drop`
  - Cannot be copied and cannot be put into global storage

### Collection Types
- `vector<T>` may have `copy`, `drop`, and `store` depending on the abilities of `T`
  - See Conditional Abilities and Generic Types for more details

### Reference Types
- Immutable references `&` and mutable references `&mut` both have `copy` and `drop`
  - This refers to copying and dropping the reference itself, not what they refer to
  - References cannot appear in global storage, hence they do not have `store`

### Global Storage
- None of the primitive types have `key`, meaning none of them can be used directly with the global storage operations

## Annotating Structs

To declare that a struct has an ability, it is declared with `has <ability>` after the struct name but before the fields. For example:

```move
struct Ignorable has drop { f: u64 }
struct Pair has copy, drop, store { x: u64, y: u64 }
```

In this case: `Ignorable` has the `drop` ability. `Pair` has `copy`, `drop`, and `store`.

### Field Requirements

All of these abilities have strong guarantees over these gated operations. The operation can be performed on the value only if it has that ability; even if the value is deeply nested inside of some other collection!

As such: when declaring a struct's abilities, certain requirements are placed on the fields. All fields must satisfy these constraints. These rules are necessary so that structs satisfy the reachability rules for the abilities given above. If a struct is declared with the ability...

- `copy`, all fields must have `copy`
- `drop`, all fields must have `drop`
- `store`, all fields must have `store`
- `key`, all fields must have `store`

`key` is the only ability currently that doesn't require itself.

### Examples of Field Requirements

```move
// A struct without any abilities
struct NoAbilities {}

struct WantsCopy has copy {
    f: NoAbilities, // ERROR 'NoAbilities' does not have 'copy'
}
```

And similarly:

```move
// A struct without any abilities
struct NoAbilities {}

struct MyResource has key {
    f: NoAbilities, // Error 'NoAbilities' does not have 'store'
}
```

## Conditional Abilities and Generic Types

When abilities are annotated on a generic type, not all instances of that type are guaranteed to have that ability. Consider this struct declaration:

```move
struct Cup<T> has copy, drop, store, key { item: T }
```

It might be very helpful if `Cup` could hold any type, regardless of its abilities. The type system can see the type parameter, so it should be able to remove abilities from `Cup` if it sees a type parameter that would violate the guarantees for that ability.

This behavior might sound a bit confusing at first, but it might be more understandable if we think about collection types. We could consider the builtin type `vector` to have the following type declaration:

```move
vector<T> has copy, drop, store;
```

We want vectors to work with any type. We don't want separate vector types for different abilities. So what are the rules we would want? Precisely the same that we would want with the field rules above. So, it would be safe to copy a vector value only if the inner elements can be copied. It would be safe to ignore a vector value only if the inner elements can be ignored/dropped. And, it would be safe to put a vector in global storage only if the inner elements can be in global storage.

### Conditional Ability Rules

To have this extra expressiveness, a type might not have all the abilities it was declared with depending on the instantiation of that type; instead, the abilities a type will have depends on both its declaration and its type arguments. For any type, type parameters are pessimistically assumed to be used inside of the struct, so the abilities are only granted if the type parameters meet the requirements described above for fields. Taking `Cup` from above as an example:

- `Cup` has the ability `copy` only if `T` has `copy`
- It has `drop` only if `T` has `drop`
- It has `store` only if `T` has `store`
- It has `key` only if `T` has `store`

## Examples of Conditional Abilities

### Example: Conditional Copy

```move
struct NoAbilities {}
struct S has copy, drop { f: bool }
struct Cup<T> has copy, drop, store { item: T }

fun example(c_x: Cup<u64>, c_s: Cup<S>) {
    // Valid, 'Cup<u64>' has 'copy' because 'u64' has 'copy'
    let c_x2 = copy c_x;
    // Valid, 'Cup<S>' has 'copy' because 'S' has 'copy'
    let c_s2 = copy c_s;
}

fun invalid(c_account: Cup<signer>, c_n: Cup<NoAbilities>) {
    // Invalid, 'Cup<signer>' does not have 'copy'.
    // Even though 'Cup' was declared with copy, the instance does not have 'copy'
    // because 'signer' does not have 'copy'
    let c_account2 = copy c_account;
    // Invalid, 'Cup<NoAbilities>' does not have 'copy'
    // because 'NoAbilities' does not have 'copy'
    let c_n2 = copy c_n;
}
```

### Example: Conditional Drop

```move
struct NoAbilities {}
struct S has copy, drop { f: bool }
struct Cup<T> has copy, drop, store { item: T }

fun unused() {
    Cup<bool> { item: true }; // Valid, 'Cup<bool>' has 'drop'
    Cup<S> { item: S { f: false }}; // Valid, 'Cup<S>' has 'drop'
}

fun left_in_local(c_account: Cup<signer>): u64 {
    let c_b = Cup<bool> { item: true };
    let c_s = Cup<S> { item: S { f: false }};
    // Valid return: 'c_account', 'c_b', and 'c_s' have values
    // but 'Cup<signer>', 'Cup<bool>', and 'Cup<S>' have 'drop'
    0
}

fun invalid_unused() {
    // Invalid, Cannot ignore 'Cup<NoAbilities>' because it does not have 'drop'.
    // Even though 'Cup' was declared with 'drop', the instance does not have 'drop'
    // because 'NoAbilities' does not have 'drop'
    Cup<NoAbilities> { item: NoAbilities {}};
}

fun invalid_left_in_local(): u64 {
    let n = Cup<NoAbilities> { item: NoAbilities {}};
    // Invalid return: 'n' has a value
    // and 'Cup<NoAbilities>' does not have 'drop'
    0
}
```

### Example: Conditional Store

```move
struct Cup<T> has copy, drop, store { item: T }

// 'MyInnerResource' is declared with 'store' so all fields need 'store'
struct MyInnerResource has store {
    yes: Cup<u64>, // Valid, 'Cup<u64>' has 'store'
    // no: Cup<signer>, Invalid, 'Cup<signer>' does not have 'store'
}

// 'MyResource' is declared with 'key' so all fields need 'store'
struct MyResource has key {
    yes: Cup<u64>, // Valid, 'Cup<u64>' has 'store'
    inner: Cup<MyInnerResource>, // Valid, 'Cup<MyInnerResource>' has 'store'
    // no: Cup<signer>, Invalid, 'Cup<signer>' does not have 'store'
}
```

### Example: Conditional Key

```move
struct NoAbilities {}
struct MyResource<T> has key { f: T }

fun valid(account: &signer) acquires MyResource {
    let addr = signer::address_of(account);
     // Valid, 'MyResource<u64>' has 'key'
    let has_resource = exists<MyResource<u64>>(addr);
    if (!has_resource) {
         // Valid, 'MyResource<u64>' has 'key'
        move_to(account, MyResource<u64> { f: 0 })
    };
    // Valid, 'MyResource<u64>' has 'key'
    let r = borrow_global_mut<MyResource<u64>>(addr);
    r.f = r.f + 1;
}

fun invalid(account: &signer) {
    let addr = signer::address_of(account);
   // Invalid, 'MyResource<NoAbilities>' does not have 'key'
   let has_it = exists<MyResource<NoAbilities>>(addr);
   // Invalid, 'MyResource<NoAbilities>' does not have 'key'
   let NoAbilities {} = move_from<MyResource<NoAbilities>>(addr);
   // Invalid, 'MyResource<NoAbilities>' does not have 'key'
   move_to(account, MyResource<NoAbilities> { f: NoAbilities {} });
   // Invalid, 'MyResource<NoAbilities>' does not have 'key'
   borrow_global<MyResource<NoAbilities>>(addr);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Minimal abilities** - Only grant abilities that are necessary for your use case
2. **Resource safety** - Don't give `copy` or `drop` to valuable resources like tokens
3. **Storage design** - Use `key` for top-level resources, `store` for nested data
4. **Generic constraints** - Consider how type parameters affect conditional abilities
5. **Documentation** - Clearly document why certain abilities are or aren't granted

## Common Ability Patterns

### Value Types (Data)
```move
struct Point has copy, drop, store {
    x: u64,
    y: u64,
}
```

### Resource Types (Assets)
```move
struct Coin has store {
    value: u64,
}
```

### Global Resources
```move
struct Account has key {
    balance: u64,
    sequence_number: u64,
}
```

### Generic Containers
```move
struct Box<T> has copy, drop, store {
    item: T,
}
// Abilities depend on T's abilities
```

## Ability Interactions Summary

| Ability | Gates | Field Requirements | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| `copy` | `copy` operator, `*` dereference | All fields must have `copy` | Enables value duplication |
| `drop` | Ignoring values, scope exit | All fields must have `drop` | Enables automatic cleanup |
| `store` | Nested in global storage | All fields must have `store` | Required for storage nesting |
| `key` | Global storage operations | All fields must have `store` | Enables top-level storage |

## Summary

Type abilities control what operations are permitted on values in Move:

- **Four abilities**: `copy`, `drop`, `store`, and `key` gate different operations
- **Field requirements**: Struct abilities require all fields to have compatible abilities
- **Conditional abilities**: Generic types inherit abilities based on type parameters
- **Resource safety**: Abilities prevent accidental duplication or loss of valuable resources
- **Storage control**: `store` and `key` abilities manage global storage access

Abilities provide fine-grained control over type behavior and resource safety in Move.
