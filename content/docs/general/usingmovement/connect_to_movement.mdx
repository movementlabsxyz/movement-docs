This guide will show you how to use blockchains on the movement network. Everything from setting up the wallet to connecting to the chain, getting testnet tokens from the faucet, and using the explorer will be covered in this guide.

Let’s start by installing a wallet. We recommend using OKX Wallet, Razor, and Nightly, which work on Chrome, Brave, Opera, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers.

Install the Chrome extensions here:
- [OKX Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/okx-wallet/mcohilncbfahbmgdjkbpemcciiolgcge)
-  [Razor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/razor-wallet/fdcnegogpncmfejlfnffnofpngdiejii)
-  [Nightly](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nightly/fiikommddbeccaoicoejoniammnalkfa)

## Connecting to the Movement Network

There are three chains live on the Movement:

1. Aptos Move
2. Sui Move
3. Move EVM (MEVM)

Aptos Move is in Testnet and Devnet, while Sui Move and Move EVM (MEVM) are in Devnet only.

dApps deployed across these chains will work on both Razor and Nightly wallets.

Let’s try and use them on Movement’s Faucet, for example, on MEVM.

**Step 1: Access the Movement Faucet**

1. Open your browser and go to [Movement Faucet](https://faucet.movementlabs.xyz/).
2. Select the chain you want to use. For this example, select “MEVM” in the mock tokens section.

2. Choose either Razor Wallet or Nightly Wallet from the list of available wallets.

**Step 3: Approve Access Request**

1. Your wallet will request access to connect to the Movement Faucet.
2. Approve the access request by clicking “Confirm”.

**Step 4: Get Mock Tokens**

1. Now that the wallet is connected, you can mint dummy tokens as per your needs.

Using this faucet, you can get testnet tokens across any movement chain.
