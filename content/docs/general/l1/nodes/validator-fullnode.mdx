title: Validator Fullnode (VFN)
description: "Complete guide to running Movement validator fullnodes"
---

Running a validator fullnode is not supported on the Movement Network at this time.

## System Requirements

When validator fullnodes become available, they will serve as secure data access layers for validators. For detailed specifications and planning information, see System Requirements (Coming Soon).

## What VFNs Will Provide

When available, validator fullnodes will offer:
- **Security Layer**: Acts as a buffer between validators and public networks
- **API Services**: Provides REST API and WebSocket endpoints
- **Load Balancing**: Reduces load on validator nodes
- **Data Distribution**: Serves blockchain data to ecosystem applications
