### 1. API Layer

#### REST API

The REST API provides _**standard endpoints**_ for common blockchain operations, enabling _**direct resource queries**_ to Move resources and _**secure transaction submission**_ for broadcasting. The API supports _**real-time state inspection**_ and querying capabilities.

#### WebSocket Events

WebSocket events deliver _**real-time updates**_ through live transaction and block notifications, featuring _**selective event filtering**_ for subscription and _**low latency**_ with minimal delay for event delivery. The system ensures _**reliable delivery**_ with guaranteed event ordering.

#### GraphQL Interface

The GraphQL interface enables _**flexible queries**_ for complex multi-resource operations, providing _**type-safe query construction**_ through schema definition and supporting _**efficient data aggregation**_ and computation. The system includes _**query result caching**_ for performance optimization.

### 2. Execution Layer

#### Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM)

The MoveVM provides _**native execution**_ of Move bytecode, featuring _**precise gas metering**_ that accounts for instruction, storage, and payload costs. It enforces _**type safety**_ through Move’s static and dynamic safety checks, including resource ownership rules, and ensures _**sandboxing**_ by isolating transaction execution within the VM environment.

#### Transaction Pipeline

The transaction pipeline enables _**parallel processing**_ through [Block-STM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06871), which applies _**dynamic dependency resolution**_ to detect read/write conflicts and order transactions consistently. The system supports _**speculative execution**_ with optimistic parallel execution, where transactions may be aborted and re-executed as needed, and Block-STM guarantees that transactions are only _**committed in deterministic order**_ once all prior dependencies are finalized.

#### State Management

State management maintains a _**consistent global state view**_ of all account and resource data. It integrates with [Block-STM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06871) to provide _**deterministic commit ordering**_ of state changes. For performance, it uses _**in-memory buffering and caching**_ during execution. Finalized state updates are written through _**efficient serialization**_ and stored in _**authenticated data structures**_, ensuring both persistence and verifiability.


### 3. Consensus Layer

#### Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus

The BFT consensus mechanism uses a _**modified HotStuff-based algorithm**_ designed for high throughput, providing _**safety**_ guarantees that ensure consistency even with up to 1/3 malicious validators. The system maintains _**liveness**_ by ensuring progress under network asynchrony, while delivering _**single-slot finality**_ for fast transaction confirmation.

#### Validator Network

The validator network operates on a _**proof-of-stake**_ model that enables energy-efficient validation through token staking, featuring a _**dynamic set**_ where validators can join or leave based on their stake and performance. The system implements _**regular leader rotation**_ for decentralization and includes _**slashing**_ mechanisms that impose penalties for malicious or negligent behavior.

#### Leader Selection

Leader selection employs a _**deterministic**_ approach with cryptographically verifiable selection that is _**weighted**_ based on validator stake, ensuring _**fair**_ distribution and preventing leader monopolization while maintaining _**efficient**_ operation with minimal computational overhead.

### 4. Storage Layer

#### Account Store

The account store implements _**address-based**_ direct mapping from addresses to account data, providing _**native storage**_ of Move resources with _**optimized access patterns**_ for common operations. The system includes _**state data compression**_ for storage efficiency.

#### Merkle Trees

Merkle trees provide a _**cryptographic state root**_ commitment to global state, enabling _**efficient proof generation**_ for state verification and supporting _**incremental updates**_ with minimal computation for state changes. The system ensures _**fast verification**_ of state transitions.

#### Transaction History

Transaction history maintains a _**complete ledger**_ with full history of all transactions, featuring _**efficient indexing**_ for querying by various criteria and _**optional pruning**_ of historical data for storage optimization. The system provides an _**immutable audit trail**_ of all state changes.

## Network Architecture

### 1. Node Types

#### Validator Nodes

Validator nodes provide _**active consensus participation**_ in block production, performing _**state validation**_ by verifying all state transitions and contributing to _**network security**_ through staking mechanisms. These nodes participate in _**protocol governance**_ decisions.

#### Full Nodes

Full nodes maintain _**complete state synchronization**_ of the blockchain state, providing _**transaction relay**_ services that forward transactions to the validator network and offering _**API services**_ with endpoints for applications. These nodes ensure _**data availability**_ for network participants.

#### Light Nodes

Light nodes implement _**selective synchronization**_ by syncing only relevant account data, performing _**proof verification**_ without maintaining full state and achieving _**resource efficiency**_ with minimal storage and bandwidth requirements. These nodes provide _**mobile support**_ optimized for mobile and embedded devices.

### 2. Network Communication

#### Peer-to-Peer Protocol

The peer-to-peer protocol implements a _**gossip network**_ for efficient information dissemination, featuring _**automatic peer discovery**_ of network participants and _**robust connection management**_ with handling and recovery capabilities. The system includes _**cryptographic message authentication**_ for verification.

#### Mempool

The mempool manages _**pending transactions**_ in a transaction pool, implementing _**priority-based ordering**_ for transaction selection and providing _**spam protection**_ against malicious transactions. The system includes _**broadcast optimization**_ for efficient transaction propagation.

## Security Architecture

#### Cryptographic Primitives

The system employs _**Ed25519 digital signatures**_ for transaction authentication, _**SHA-3 hash functions**_ for data integrity and commitments, and _**efficient Merkle proofs**_ for state and transaction verification. The architecture includes _**verifiable random beacons**_ for leader selection.

#### Access Control

Access control implements an _**address-based account model**_ with _**Move's resource ownership model**_ for asset safety, featuring _**fine-grained permission systems**_ for management and _**multi-signature support**_ for transaction authorization.

#### Network Security

Network security provides _**DDoS protection**_ against network attacks, implements _**rate limiting**_ to prevent resource exhaustion, and ensures _**cryptographic validator authentication**_ for identity verification. The system includes _**slashing conditions**_ that create economic incentives for honest behavior.

## Performance Characteristics

#### Throughput

The system targets _**10,000+ transactions per second**_ with _**burst capacity**_ for higher throughput during brief periods. Future development includes _**horizontal scaling through sharding**_ and _**continuous performance optimization**_ for sustained improvements.

#### Latency

The system achieves _**1-2 second block production**_ with _**single-block finality**_ and _**sub-second transaction confirmation**_. The architecture minimizes _**network propagation delay**_ for optimal performance.

#### Storage
