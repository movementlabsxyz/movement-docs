The Movement Network contains three main components that enhance its performance, security, and interoperability: the Move Executor, the Fast Finality Settlement Module, and the Decentralized Shared Sequencer. Each of these components plays a crucial role in ensuring the operation of Move-based chains.

## Move Executor

The Move Executor is a core component of the Move-based chain, supporting both MoveVM and EVM bytecode. This dual compatibility provides a robust execution environment, enabling developers to leverage the advanced features of the Move language while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum applications. The Move Executor integrates the parallel execution capabilities of MoveVM with existing EVM interpreters, ensuring compatibility and scalability.

## Fast Finality Settlement (FFS)

The Fast Finality Settlement (FFS) module is designed to provide fast confirmations and settlement for transactions. By utilizing a network of validators who stake assets and attest to the correctness of state transitions, this module ensures crypto-economic security and reduces latency. The validators combine the security benefits of staking with the efficiency of rapid transaction finality.

The Fast Finality Settlement includes Postconfirmations, see [this blog](https://blog.movementlabs.xyz/article/postconfirmations-L2s-rollups-blockchain-movement) (on-L1) and fastconfirmations (off-L1).

### Security Mechanism

- **Ethereum Settlement**: Validators stake assets to provide economic security, ensuring significant financial interest in network integrity.
- **ZK and Optimistic Rollups**: ZK-rollups offer security through validity proofs, while optimistic rollups rely on challenge periods for dispute resolution. Both methods have higher latency and computational costs.
- **Fast Finality Settlement (FFS) Chains**: Offers Fast Finality Settlement and high economic security without extensive proof generation or challenge periods, reducing latency and improving user experience compared to ZK and optimistic rollups.

### Comparison with ZK and optimistic rollups

- FFS chains do not require expensive proof generation equipment, unlike ZK-rollups.
- FFS chains provide significantly reduced latency compared to both optimistic and ZK-rollups, with finality settlement in seconds.
- FFS is crucial for interoperability and atomic cross-chain transactions, making FFS chains an ideal solution for many applications.

## Decentralized Shared Sequencer

This component is a decentralized and shared sequencing mechanism that enhances network robustness, fairness, and censorship resistance. By providing customizable transaction ordering, the sequencer supports cross-chain atomic transactions and pooled liquidity within the Movement Network ecosystem. This shared sequencer ensures fair and efficient transaction ordering across all participating chains.
