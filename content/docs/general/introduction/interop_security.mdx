The Movement Network leverages mechanisms to ensure robust interoperability and high security across its ecosystem. Key components include the Shared Decentralized Sequencer and Multi-Asset Staking.

## Shared Decentralized Sequencer

This component provides a decentralized and shared sequencing mechanism, enhancing network robustness, fairness, and censorship resistance. It supports cross-chain atomic transactions and pooled liquidity within the Movement Network ecosystem. This shared sequencer is a crucial component of the Movement Network, ensuring that all participating chains can achieve fair and efficient transaction ordering.

## Multi-Asset Staking

The shared decentralized sequencer utilizes a PoS system, allowing for multi-asset staking to enhance economic security. This mechanism enables staking of both native and non-native tokens, boosting network security and promoting sovereignty among chains. Delegation allows for staking without operating a node, maximizing staked value and economic security. This multi-asset staking approach ensures that a diverse range of assets can be used to secure the network, enhancing overall resilience and flexibility.


> Multi-asset staking allows the inclusion of various token types, enhancing the economic security and decentralization of the network. This also empowers chains by integrating their security contributions into the overall network.
