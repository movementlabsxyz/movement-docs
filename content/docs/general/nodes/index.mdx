import React from 'react';

The Movement Mainnet consists of three main node types: 

- **Validator Nodes**
- **Validator Fullnodes (VFNs)**
- **Public Fullnodes (PFNs)**

To participate in consensus, you are required to run a validator node and stake the minimum amount of MOVE tokens. VFNs and PFNs are not required to participate in consensus, but they are essential for distributing blockchain data and enabling ecosystem services such as indexing, querying, and RESTful API services.
VFNs can only be run by validator operators, while PFNs can be run by anyone. All node types are currently in development and will be available soon.


Thus, the Movement network uses a multi-tier architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Validator     │◄──►│   Validator     │◄──►│   Validator     │
│     Node        │    │     Node        │    │     Node        │
└─────────┬───────┘    └─────────┬───────┘    └─────────┬───────┘
          │                      │                      │
          ▼                      ▼                      ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐

          └──────────┬───────────┴───────────┬──────────┘
                     │                       │
            ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐

            │   Fullnode      │      │   Fullnode      │   
            └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘

## Node Types Overview

### Validator Nodes

[View Validator Node Documentation →](/general/nodes/validator-node)

- **Purpose**: Participate in consensus protocol and validate transactions
- **Requirements**: Must stake minimum MOVE tokens
- **Rewards**: Earn staking rewards for successful validation
- **Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon
- **Requirements**: See System Requirements (Coming Soon)

### Validator Fullnodes (VFNs)

[View VFN Documentation →](/general/nodes/validator-node/validator-fullnode)

- **Purpose**: Serve as secure entry/exit points for validator operations
- **Requirements**: Can only be operated by validator operators
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability and secure data access for validators
- **Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon
- **Requirements**: See System Requirements (Coming Soon)

### Public Fullnodes (PFNs)

[View PFN Documentation →](/general/nodes/full-node)

- **Purpose**: Replicate blockchain state and provide public access
- **Requirements**: No staking required, open to anyone
- **Benefits**: Increase network decentralization and data availability
- **Use Cases**: RPC services, indexing, dApps, and ecosystem tools
- **Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon
- **Requirements**: See System Requirements (Currently Supported)

### Validation & Staking (Coming Soon)
Comprehensive guides for validation, staking, and governance will be available when Movement validators launch.

### Node Operations (Coming Soon)
Step-by-step deployment and operational guides will be available when nodes launch.

### Development Tools (Coming Soon)
Developer tools and local development environments will be available soon.

## Getting Started

All Movement node types are currently in development and will be available soon. Detailed deployment guides and operational procedures will be published when the nodes are ready for mainnet launch.

Stay tuned for updates on node availability and deployment instructions.
