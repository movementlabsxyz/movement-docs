# Movement Network Nodes

The Movement network consists of three main node types: **validator nodes**, **validator fullnodes (VFNs)**, and **public fullnodes (PFNs)**. To participate in consensus, you are required to run a validator node and stake the minimum amount of MOVE tokens. VFNs and PFNs are not required to participate in consensus, but they are essential for distributing blockchain data and enabling ecosystem services such as indexing, querying, and RESTful API services.

VFNs can only be run by validator operators, while PFNs can be run by anyone. All node types are currently in development and will be available soon.

## Node Types Overview

### Validator Nodes (Coming Soon)
- **Purpose**: Participate in consensus protocol and validate transactions
- **Requirements**: Must stake minimum MOVE tokens
- **Rewards**: Earn staking rewards for successful validation
- **Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon
- **Requirements**: See **[System Requirements](/general/nodes/requirements#validator-node---coming-soon)**

### Validator Fullnodes (VFNs) (Coming Soon)
- **Purpose**: Serve as secure entry/exit points for validator operations
- **Requirements**: Can only be operated by validator operators
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability and secure data access for validators
- **Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon
- **Requirements**: See **[System Requirements](/general/nodes/requirements#validator-fullnode-vfn---coming-soon)**

### Public Fullnodes (PFNs) (Coming Soon)
- **Purpose**: Replicate blockchain state and provide public access
- **Requirements**: No staking required, open to anyone
- **Benefits**: Increase network decentralization and data availability
- **Use Cases**: RPC services, indexing, dApps, and ecosystem tools
- **Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon
- **Requirements**: See **[System Requirements](/general/nodes/requirements#public-fullnode-pfn---currently-supported)**

Stay tuned for updates on node availability and deployment instructions.

## Architecture Overview

The Movement network uses a multi-tier architecture:

```
