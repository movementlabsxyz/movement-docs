The Movement Network consists of various node types that serve different purposes. This section covers how to deploy and operate nodes for different use cases.

## Node Types

### Full Node (PFN)

A **public fullnode (PFN)** synchronizes with the Movement blockchain and maintains recent state. Full nodes are suitable for:

- Running applications that need blockchain data
- Submitting transactions
- Querying recent state and transactions

[Learn more about Full Nodes](/general/nodes/full-node)

### Archival Node

An **archival fullnode** maintains complete blockchain history from genesis by disabling ledger pruning. Archival nodes are required for:

- Historical state queries from any point in time
- Running indexers that need full transaction history
- Providing historical data services

## Comparison

| Feature | Full Node | Archival Node |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Recent state queries | Yes | Yes |
| Historical state queries | Limited | Full history |
| Storage requirements | ~50-100GB | 700GB+ (mainnet) |
| Initial sync time | Fast (state sync) | Requires backup restore |
| Use case | Applications, transactions | Indexers, historical queries |
