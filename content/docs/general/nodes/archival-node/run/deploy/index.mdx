This section covers the different methods to deploy an archival fullnode on the Movement Network.

## Deployment Options

Choose the deployment method that best fits your needs:

| Method | Best For | Complexity |
|--------|----------|------------|
| [Docker](/general/nodes/archival-node/run/deploy/docker) | Quick setup, production use | Low |
| [Source Code](/general/nodes/archival-node/run/deploy/source) | Customization, development | Medium |

## Prerequisites

Regardless of deployment method, you'll need:

- **Storage**: 1TB+ SSD (2TB+ recommended for mainnet)
- **Memory**: 16GB+ RAM
- **CPU**: 8+ cores
- **Network**: Reliable internet connection
- **restic**: For restoring from backups ([installation](https://restic.net/))

### Install restic

restic is used to restore blockchain data from Movement Labs' public backups.

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y restic

# macOS
brew install restic

# Or download directly
curl -LO https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/download/v0.18.1/restic_0.18.1_linux_amd64.bz2
bunzip2 restic_0.18.1_linux_amd64.bz2
chmod +x restic_0.18.1_linux_amd64
sudo mv restic_0.18.1_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/restic
```

## Restore Data from Backup

Before starting your archival node, restore existing blockchain data from Movement Labs' public backups. This is the recommended approach as syncing from genesis would take an extremely long time.

Download and run the restore script from the Movement Networks repository:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
# Download the restore script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/l1_restore.sh
chmod +x l1_restore.sh

# Restore mainnet data (~700GB)
./l1_restore.sh mainnet ./data

# Or restore testnet data (~260GB)
./l1_restore.sh testnet ./data
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Restore Time**

Restoring from backup can take several hours depending on your network speed:
- Mainnet: ~700GB
- Testnet: ~260GB
</Callout>

## Configuration Files

Download the archival fullnode configuration and genesis files:

### For Mainnet

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
mkdir -p mainnet-archival && cd mainnet-archival
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/mainnet/configs/archival-fullnode.yaml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/mainnet/genesis.blob
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/mainnet/waypoint.txt
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/mainnet/genesis_waypoint.txt
```

### For Testnet

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
mkdir -p testnet-archival && cd testnet-archival
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/testnet/configs/archival-fullnode.yaml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/testnet/genesis.blob
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/testnet/waypoint.txt
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/testnet/genesis_waypoint.txt
```

## Next Steps

After restoring data and downloading configuration files, proceed to deploy:

- [Deploy with Docker](/general/nodes/archival-node/run/deploy/docker)
- [Deploy from Source](/general/nodes/archival-node/run/deploy/source)
