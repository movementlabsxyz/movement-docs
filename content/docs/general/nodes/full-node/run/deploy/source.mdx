To deploy a PFN using the `aptos-core` source code maintained by movement labs
Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the movement  `aptos-core` repo : `git clone https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core.git`.

1. Go in `aptos-core` directory: `cd aptos-core`.

2. Check out the `l1-mgiration` branch using `git checkout --track origin/l1-migration`

3. Next, download the `genesis.blob`, `waypoint.txt`, `genesis_waypoint.txt` files for the network your PFN will connect to:

   - Run this command to download the genesis blob (for testnet):
     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/testnet/genesis.blob
     ```

   - Run this command to download the waypoint file (for testnet):
     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/testnet/waypoint.txt
     ```

  - Run this command to download the genesis_waypoint file (for testnet):
     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/main/testnet/genesis_waypoint.txt
     ```
   <Callout type="warning">
   **Don't want to connect to testnet?**<br />
   To connect to other networks (e.g., `devnet` and `mainnet`), you can find the genesis, waypoint and genesis_waypoint here ➜ https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks.
   Be sure to download the `genesis.blob`, `waypoint.txt` and `genesis_waypoint.txt` for those networks.
   </Callout>

4. Next, run the command below to create a copy of the PFN configuration YAML template:
   ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
   cp config/src/config/test_data/public_full_node.yaml fullnode.yaml
   ```

5. Finally, edit the `fullnode.yaml` configuration file to ensure that your PFN: (i) contains the files you just downloaded; and (ii) saves the synchronized blockchain data to the location of your
   choice (on your local machine). To do this:

   1. Specify the correct path to the `genesis.blob` and `genesis_waypoint.txt` file you just downloaded by editing `execution.genesis_file_location` in the `fullnode.yaml` configuration. By default, it points to `genesis.blob` in the current working directory.
      ```yaml filename="fullnode.yaml"
      execution:
        genesis_file_location: ./genesis.blob # update to your path
        genesis_waypoint: 
          from_file: ./genesis_waypoint.txt
      ```
   2. Specify the correct path to the `waypoint.txt` file you just downloaded by editing `base.waypoint.from_file` in the `fullnode.yaml` configuration. By default, it points to `waypoint.txt` in the current working directory. For example:
      ```yaml filename="fullnode.yaml"
      base:
        waypoint:
          from_file: "./waypoint.txt"

   3. Specify the directory on your local machine that you want to store the blockchain database by editing the `base.data_dir` in the `fullnode.yaml` configuration. For example, you can create a directory `my-full-node/data` in your home directory and specify it as:
      ```yaml filename="fullnode.yaml"
      base:
        data_dir: "</path/to/my/homedir/my-full-node/data>"
      ```
   4. Specify the upstream peer for your PFN. The upstream peer is the node from which your PFN will synchronize blockchain data. In this example, `9967EBF40AC8C2CCB38709488952DA1826176584EA3067B63B1695362ECB3D1F` is the upstream peer_id. You can also configure this to point to your own PFN if preferred. For example:
      ```
      full_node_networks:
        - network_id: "public"
          discovery_method: "none"
          listen_address: "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/6182"
          seeds:
            9967EBF40AC8C2CCB38709488952DA1826176584EA3067B63B1695362ECB3D1F:
              addresses:
              - "/dns/consensus.testnet.movementnetwork.xyz/tcp/6182/noise-ik/9967EBF40AC8C2CCB38709488952DA1826176584EA3067B63B1695362ECB3D1F/handshake/0"
              role: "Upstream"
      ``` 

6. Start your local public fullnode by running the below command:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
cargo run -p aptos-node --release -- -f ./fullnode.yaml
```

<Callout type="info">
**Debugging?**<br />
The command above will build a release binary for `aptos-node` at: `aptos-core/target/release/aptos-node`. The release
binaries tend to be substantially faster than debug binaries but lack debugging information useful for development.
To build a debug binary, omit the `--release` flag from the command above.
</Callout>

You have now successfully configured and started running a PFN in the Movement testnet.

<Callout type="info">
**Verify your PFN**<br />
If you want to verify that your PFN is running correctly, you can follow the instructions in the [Verify a PFN](/general/nodes/full-node/run/verify) guide.
