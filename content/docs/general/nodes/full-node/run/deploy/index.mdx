The following guides provide step-by-step instructions for deploying a PFN on the Movement networks.

<Callout type="info">
**Do I have to run a PFN?**<br />
If you do not wish to run a PFN, but still want to interact with the Movement blockchain, you can use the REST API
provided by the Movement Labs' PFNs (see [Movement APIs](/build/apis)). Note, however, that Movement Labs-provided PFNs have rate
limits, which can impede your development. You can deploy your own PFN
and synchronize with the Movement blockchain directly, or use a different node infrastructure provider.

Select the guide for the deployment method you prefer:

<Callout type="warning">
**Choose a network**<br />
These guides default to deploying a PFN in the Movement testnet network, but they can easily be used to do
the same in other networks (e.g., devnet or mainnet network). To do so, check out the 
[movement-networks](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks) repo
and use the `genesis.blob` and `waypoint.txt` node files for the respective networks:
[mainnet](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/blob/main/mainnet/README.md),
[testnet](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/blob/main/testnet/README.md),
and [devnet](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks/blob/main/devnet/README.md).
