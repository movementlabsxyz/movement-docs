You can run your own public fullnode (PFN) to synchronize the state of the Movement blockchain and stay
up-to-date. PFNs replicate the entire state of the blockchain by syncing from other Movement VFNs and PFNs. PFNs
can be run by anyone. This section explains how to deploy a PFN and connect to a Movement network. You can learn
more about the different types of nodes in the [Movement L1](/general/l1/nodes) section.

**Default connection to testnet**
If you follow the default setup in this document, then your PFN will be connected to the Movement testnet. To connect
to a different Movement network, such as devnet or testnet, make sure you have the correct docker image tag, or source
code branch if you build the binary directly.

You can find the genesis and waypoint files for all the networks, here âžœ https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-networks.
