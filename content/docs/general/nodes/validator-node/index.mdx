title: Validator & VFN Overview
description: "Overview of Movement validator nodes and validator fullnodes"
---

**Validator nodes and Validator Fullnodes (VFNs) are coming soon.** 

To participate in the Movement consensus protocol, you will need to deploy and run a **validator node**. Additionally, it will be **highly recommended** to run a **validator fullnode (VFN)** to provide secure and reliable access to blockchain data.

Comprehensive deployment guides will be available when validators launch on Movement.

## Node Types Comparison

| Feature | Validator Node | Validator Fullnode (VFN) |
|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Consensus participation | Data distribution & security |
| **Required** | ✅ Yes (for consensus) | 📋 Highly recommended |
| **Staking** | ✅ Required | ❌ No staking needed |
| **Public Access** | ❌ Private network only | ✅ Public API access |
| **API Services** | ❌ Disabled for security | ✅ Full REST/WebSocket APIs |
| **Hardware** | High (consensus critical) | Moderate (data serving) |
| **Uptime** | Critical (affects rewards) | Important (affects users) |

## Getting Started

### Coming Soon: Validator Deployment

Validator node deployment guides are currently in development and will be available when Movement validators launch. The recommended validator setup will include:

### Architecture Overview

The recommended validator setup uses a two-tier architecture:

```
Internet ←→ VFN ←→ Validator Node
            ↑           ↑
    (Public APIs)  (Private Network)
    (Data Access)  (Consensus Only)
```
