# Run a Validator Fullnode (VFN)

Running a validator fullnode is not supported on the Movement Network at this time.

## Future System Requirements

When validator fullnodes become available, they will serve as secure data access layers for validators. For detailed specifications and planning information, see the **[System Requirements](/general/nodes/requirements#validator-fullnode-vfn---coming-soon)** page.

### Expected Requirements Summary
- **CPU**: 4+ cores minimum (8+ cores recommended)
- **Memory**: 16GB RAM minimum (32GB+ recommended)  
- **Storage**: 500GB+ SSD (1TB+ NVMe recommended)
- **Network**: 1Gbps+ internet connection
- **Access**: Can only be operated by validator operators

## What VFNs Will Provide

When available, validator fullnodes will offer:
- **Security Layer**: Acts as a buffer between validators and public networks
- **API Services**: Provides REST API and WebSocket endpoints
- **Load Balancing**: Reduces load on validator nodes
- **Data Distribution**: Serves blockchain data to ecosystem applications
