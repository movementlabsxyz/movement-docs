Movement provides several networks with different architectures for development and production needs:

### L1 Networks
1. **[L1 (Testnet)](/general/networks/testnet)** — A native L1 testing environment that provides developers with a safe space to build and test applications using the full Move execution environment before deploying to production networks.
2. **[L1 (Devnet)](/general/networks/devnet)** — A native L1 development network for testing the latest protocol features and upgrades, providing early access to new functionality in the Movement ecosystem.

### Sidechain Networks
3. **[Sidechain (Mainnet)](/general/networks/mainnet)** — Currently operating as a sidechain serving production traffic with real economic value. This network will eventually migrate to become the flagship L1 network.
