# Movement Networks

## Network Overview

Movement provides several networks with different architectures for development and production needs:

### L1 Networks (Native Move Blockchain)
1. **[Testnet](/general/networks/testnet)** — L1 testing environment for developers to build and test applications with native Move execution.
2. **[Devnet](/general/networks/devnet)** — L1 development network for testing latest features and protocol upgrades.

### Sidechain Networks (Ethereum-Secured)
3. **[Mainnet](/general/networks/mainnet)** — Production sidechain secured by Ethereum L1, currently serving as the main network until L1 migration.
4. **[Sidechain](/general/networks/sidechain)** — Legacy sidechain implementation, now consolidated into mainnet operations.

### Network Properties

| Network | Type | Chain ID | Genesis | Faucet | Governance | Update Schedule | Data Persistence |
|---------|------|----------|---------|---------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Mainnet (Sidechain)** | Ethereum-Secured | 126 | Coming Soon | N/A | Transitioning to L1 | Monthly, varies | Permanent |
| **Testnet (L1)** | Native L1 | 250 | Coming Soon | Coming Soon | Managed by Movement Labs | Monthly, varies | Resets as Needed, but avoided |
| **Devnet (L1)** | Native L1 | 27 | Coming Soon | Coming Soon | Managed by Movement Labs | As updated | Resets as Needed |

## Network Details

For comprehensive information about each network, visit the dedicated pages:

### **[Movement Mainnet (Sidechain)](/general/networks/mainnet)**
Currently operating as an Ethereum-secured sidechain serving production traffic with real economic value. This network will eventually migrate to become the flagship L1 network.

### **[Movement Sidechain](/general/networks/sidechain)**
Technical documentation for the sidechain architecture and implementation, including details on how the current mainnet operates as an Ethereum-secured sidechain.

### **[Movement Testnet (L1)](/general/networks/testnet)**  
A native L1 testing environment that provides developers with a safe space to build and test applications using the full Move execution environment before deploying to production networks.

### **[Movement Devnet (L1)](/general/networks/devnet)**
A native L1 development network for testing the latest protocol features and upgrades, providing early access to new functionality in the Movement ecosystem.
