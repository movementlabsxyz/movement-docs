Movement Devnet is a native L1 blockchain network that serves as the development environment for testing the latest protocol features and upgrades. Unlike the current mainnet sidechain, devnet operates as a full L1 blockchain with native Move execution.

#### Devnet vs Testnet

**Devnet** is for experimental development with rapid updates and frequent resets, while **testnet** provides a stable, production-like environment with persistent data for pre-production testing.

## Key Features

The devnet is development-focused with the following features:

- **Latest Features**: Access to cutting-edge protocol features before they reach other networks
- **Rapid Updates**: Weekly updates with new functionality and improvements
- **Experimental APIs**: Early access to new APIs and developer tools
- **Reset Capability**: Network resets for major upgrades and testing

## Network Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Network Type** | Native L1 Blockchain |
| **Consensus** | BFT Consensus |
| **Block Time** | ~1 second (Target) |
