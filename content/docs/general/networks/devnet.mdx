# Movement Devnet (L1)

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon**: Movement L1 Devnet is currently under development. Please check back later for updates.
</Callout>

## Overview

Movement Devnet is a native L1 blockchain network that serves as the development environment for testing the latest protocol features and upgrades. Unlike the current mainnet sidechain, devnet operates as a full L1 blockchain with native Move execution.

## L1 Architecture

Devnet represents the future architecture of Movement networks:

- **Native Move Execution**: Full MoveVM execution environment without Ethereum dependency
- **Consensus**: Native blockchain consensus mechanism
- **Validator Network**: Decentralized validator set securing the network
- **Transaction Processing**: Direct Move transaction processing
- **State Management**: Native blockchain state management

## Key Features

### Development-Focused
- **Latest Features**: Access to cutting-edge protocol features before they reach other networks
- **Rapid Updates**: Weekly updates with new functionality and improvements
- **Experimental APIs**: Early access to new APIs and developer tools
- **Reset Capability**: Network can be reset for major upgrades and testing

### Native L1 Benefits
- **True Decentralization**: No reliance on external chains for security
- **Optimized Performance**: Designed specifically for Move execution
- **Lower Costs**: Direct execution without bridge overhead
- **Enhanced Security**: Native consensus and validation

## Development Use Cases

### Protocol Development
- Test new consensus mechanisms
- Validate protocol upgrades
- Experiment with new transaction types
- Performance testing and optimization

### Application Development
- Build and test Move applications
- Integration testing with L1 features
- Performance benchmarking
- Migration preparation from sidechain

### Tooling and Infrastructure
- Test new developer tools
- Validate indexing and analytics services
- Infrastructure stress testing
- API and SDK development

## Network Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Network Type** | Native L1 Blockchain |
| **Consensus** | Movement Consensus (Details TBD) |
| **Block Time** | ~1 second (Target) |
| **Finality** | Fast finality (Details TBD) |
| **Validators** | Managed by Movement Labs |
| **Updates** | Weekly |
| **Data Retention** | Reset on major updates |
| **Faucet** | Available via API |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of Move language and concepts
- Development environment setup
- Movement CLI tools installed

### Access
Once available, devnet access will include:
- RPC endpoints for application integration
- Faucet access for test tokens
- Explorer for transaction and block browsing
- Development tools and SDKs

### Migration Path
Devnet serves as a preview of the future L1 architecture:

1. **Current**: Mainnet operates as Ethereum sidechain
2. **Testing**: Devnet and Testnet operate as native L1
3. **Future**: Mainnet will migrate to native L1 architecture

## Differences from Sidechain

| Aspect | Sidechain (Current Mainnet) | L1 (Devnet) |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Security** | Ethereum-secured | Native validators |
| **Consensus** | Ethereum finality | Native consensus |
| **Transaction Processing** | Bridge + execution | Direct execution |
| **Gas Fees** | ETH-based | Native token |
| **Finality** | Ethereum block time | Fast L1 finality |
| **Decentralization** | Ethereum dependent | Fully independent |

## Development Resources

### Coming Soon
- **RPC Documentation**: Complete API reference for L1 interactions
- **Move Examples**: Sample applications built for L1 architecture
- **Migration Guides**: How to prepare applications for L1 migration
- **Performance Benchmarks**: L1 vs sidechain performance comparisons

### Tools and SDKs
- Movement CLI for L1 interactions
- TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs
- Rust SDKs for native integration
- Development frameworks and templates

## Migration Preparation

### For Developers
- **Learn Native Move**: Understand differences from sidechain execution
- **Test Applications**: Validate compatibility with L1 architecture
- **Optimize Performance**: Take advantage of L1-specific optimizations
- **Update Dependencies**: Ensure SDKs and tools support L1

### For Infrastructure Providers
- **Node Operations**: Prepare for native validator requirements
- **API Services**: Adapt to L1 RPC interfaces
- **Indexing**: Update for native blockchain data structures
- **Monitoring**: Implement L1-specific health checks

## Timeline and Roadmap

### Phase 1: Devnet Launch (Current)
- Core L1 infrastructure development
- Basic Move execution environment
- Developer tool integration

### Phase 2: Testnet Migration
- Testnet transitions to L1 architecture
- Production-like testing environment
- Community validator onboarding

### Phase 3: Mainnet Migration
- Mainnet transitions from sidechain to L1
- Full decentralization
- Production L1 network
