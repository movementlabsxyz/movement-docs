Movement Devnet is a native L1 blockchain network that serves as the development environment for testing the latest protocol features and upgrades. Unlike the current mainnet sidechain, devnet operates as a full L1 blockchain with native Move execution.

#### Devnet vs Testnet

**Devnet** is for experimental development with rapid updates and frequent resets, while **testnet** provides a stable, production-like environment with persistent data for pre-production testing.

## Key Features

The devnet is development-focused with the following features:

- **Latest Features**: Access to cutting-edge protocol features before they reach other networks
- **Rapid Updates**: Weekly updates with new functionality and improvements
- **Experimental APIs**: Early access to new APIs and developer tools
- **Reset Capability**: Network resets for major upgrades and testing

## Network Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Network Type** | Native L1 Blockchain |
| **Consensus** | BFT Consensus |
| **Block Time** | ~1 second (Target) |
| **Finality** | ~1 second (Details TBD) |
| **Validators** | Managed by Movement Labs |
| **Data Retention** | Reset on major updates |
| **Faucet** | Available via API |


## Use Cases

#### Protocol Development

Protocol development involves testing _**new consensus mechanisms**_, validating _**protocol upgrades**_, experimenting with _**new transaction types**_, and conducting _**performance testing and optimization**_.

#### Application Development

Application development includes building and testing _**Move applications**_, performing _**integration testing**_ with L1 features, conducting _**performance benchmarking**_, and preparing for _**migration from sidechain**_.

#### Tooling and Infrastructure

Tooling and infrastructure development covers testing _**new developer tools**_, validating _**indexing and analytics services**_, conducting _**infrastructure stress testing**_, and developing _**API and SDK**_ capabilities.


## Migration Preparation

#### For Developers

For developers, preparation involves _**testing applications**_ and  _**optimizing performance**_ to take advantage of L1-specific optimizations, and _**updating dependencies**_ to ensure SDKs and tools support L1.

#### For Infrastructure Providers

For infrastructure providers, preparation includes _**node operations**_ to prepare for native validator requirements, _**API services**_ adaptation to L1 RPC interfaces, _**indexing**_ updates for native blockchain data structures, and _**monitoring**_ implementation of L1-specific health checks.
