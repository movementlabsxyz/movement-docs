**Coming Soon**: Movement L1 (Testnet) documentation is currently under development. Please check back later for updates.
</Callout>

## Additional Resources

- **[Faucet](https://faucet.movementnetwork.xyz/)** - Get testnet tokens

## Overview

Movement Testnet is a native L1 blockchain network that provides a production-like testing environment for developers to build and test applications before deploying to the production networks. Unlike the current mainnet sidechain, testnet operates as a full L1 blockchain with native Move execution.

## L1 Architecture

Testnet represents the stable testing version of Movement's L1 architecture:

- **Native Move Execution**: Full MoveVM execution environment without Ethereum dependency
- **Production-Like Consensus**: Stable consensus mechanism mirroring future mainnet L1
- **Decentralized Validators**: Community and partner validators securing the network
- **Persistent State**: Long-term data retention for reliable testing
- **Stable APIs**: Production-ready interfaces for application development

## Key Features

### Production-Ready Testing
- **Stable Environment**: Persistent network with reliable uptime
- **Realistic Conditions**: Production-like network conditions and performance
- **Community Validators**: Decentralized validator set for realistic testing
- **Persistent Data**: Long-term data retention for continuous development

### L1 Benefits
- **True Decentralization**: Independent blockchain without external dependencies
- **Optimized Performance**: Native Move execution with L1-specific optimizations
- **Lower Latency**: Direct transaction processing without bridge delays
- **Enhanced Security**: Native consensus and cryptographic security

## Network Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Network Type** | Native L1 Blockchain |
| **Consensus** | Movement Consensus (Production-ready) |
| **Block Time** | ~1 second |
| **Finality** | Fast finality |
| **Validators** | Community + Movement Labs |
| **Updates** | Monthly (coordinated) |
| **Data Retention** | Permanent |
| **Faucet** | [Available](https://faucet.movementnetwork.xyz/) |

## Use Cases

### Application Development
- **Pre-Production Testing**: Test applications in production-like conditions
- **Integration Testing**: Validate integrations with realistic network behavior  
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark application performance on L1
- **User Acceptance Testing**: End-to-end testing with real user flows

### Infrastructure Testing
- **Validator Setup**: Test validator node configurations
- **API Services**: Validate RPC and indexing services
- **Monitoring**: Test infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- **Scaling**: Test infrastructure under load

### Migration Preparation
- **Sidechain to L1**: Test applications for L1 compatibility
- **Tool Validation**: Ensure development tools work with L1
- **Workflow Testing**: Validate deployment and operational workflows
- **Training**: Familiarize teams with L1 operations

## Differences from Current Mainnet

| Aspect | Mainnet (Sidechain) | L1 (Testnet) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Security Model** | Ethereum-secured | Native validators |
| **Transaction Flow** | Bridge â†’ Execute | Direct execution |
| **Consensus** | Ethereum finality | Native consensus |
| **Gas Token** | ETH-based | Native MOVE tokens |
| **Finality Time** | ~12-15 seconds | ~1-2 seconds |
| **Validator Set** | Ethereum miners | Movement validators |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
