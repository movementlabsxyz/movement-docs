Movement Testnet is a native L1 blockchain network that provides a production-like testing environment for developers to build and test applications before deploying to the production networks. Unlike the current mainnet [sidechain](/general/sidechain), testnet operates as a full [L1 blockchain](/general/l1).

## Key Features

Testnet represents the stable testing version of Movement's L1 architecture:

- **Stable Environment**: Persistent network with reliable uptime
- **Production-Ready Conditions**: Production-like network conditions, consensus and performance
- **Community Validators**: Decentralized validator set for realistic testing
- **Persistent Data**: Long-term data retention for continuous development
- **Stable APIs**: Production-ready interfaces for application development


## Network Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Network Type** | Native L1 Blockchain |
| **Consensus** | BFT Consensus |
| **Block Time** | ~1 second |
| **Finality** | ~1 second (Details TBA) |
| **Validators** | Community + Movement Labs |
| **Data Retention** | Permanent |

<Callout type="info">
Migration preparation involves _**sidechain to L1**_ testing to ensure applications are compatible with L1 architecture, _**tool validation**_ to ensure development tools work with L1, _**workflow testing**_ to validate deployment and operational workflows, and _**training**_ to familiarize teams with L1 operations.
</Callout>


## Use Cases

#### Application Development

Testnet enables comprehensive application development through _**pre-production testing**_ in production-like conditions, _**integration testing**_ to validate integrations with realistic network behavior, _**performance testing**_ to benchmark application performance on L1, and _**user acceptance testing**_ for end-to-end testing with real user flows.

#### Infrastructure Testing

Infrastructure testing includes _**validator setup**_ for testing validator node configurations, _**API services**_ validation for RPC and indexing services, _**monitoring**_ implementation for infrastructure monitoring and alerting, and _**scaling**_ tests to validate infrastructure performance under load.

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- [Movement CLI tools](/devs/movementcli) installed
- Understanding of [Move language](/general/l1/move-language)
- Testnet MOVE tokens from [faucet](https://faucet.movementnetwork.xyz/)
