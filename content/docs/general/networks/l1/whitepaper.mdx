- **Slashing**: Economic penalties for malicious or negligent behavior
- **Rewards**: Staking rewards for honest validation and block production

#### 2.2.3 Block Production

Block production follows a deterministic leader selection algorithm:

```rust
fn select_leader(validators: &ValidatorSet, round: u64, randomness: &[u8]) -> ValidatorId {
    let seed = combine(round, randomness);
    weighted_selection(&validators, &seed)
}
```

### 2.3 Move Virtual Machine

#### 2.3.3 Parallel Execution

Transaction execution can be parallelized when dependencies allow:

```rust
struct ParallelExecutor {
    worker_pool: ThreadPool,
    dependency_graph: DependencyAnalyzer,
    conflict_detector: ConflictDetector,
}

impl ParallelExecutor {
    fn execute_batch(&self, transactions: Vec<Transaction>) -> Vec<ExecutionResult> {
        let dependency_groups = self.dependency_graph.analyze(&transactions);
        let results = dependency_groups.par_iter()
            .map(|group| self.execute_group(group))
            .collect();
        self.resolve_conflicts(results)
    }
}
```

├── Account Subtree
│   ├── Address_1 → {Resources, Modules}
│   ├── Address_2 → {Resources, Modules}
│   └── ...
├── Events Subtree
│   ├── Event_Stream_1 → [Event_1, Event_2, ...]
│   └── ...
└── Metadata Subtree
    ├── Validator Set
    ├── Network Configuration
    └── ...
```

- **Staking**: Validator staking for network security
- **Governance**: Voting on protocol upgrades and parameters
- **Incentives**: Rewards for validators and network participants

#### 3.1.2 Fee Structure

Transaction fees are calculated based on resource consumption:

```rust
struct GasSchedule {
    instruction_costs: HashMap<Opcode, Gas>,
    storage_costs: StorageGasSchedule,
    network_costs: NetworkGasSchedule,
}

fn calculate_fee(transaction: &Transaction, gas_used: Gas, gas_price: GasPrice) -> Fee {
    let base_fee = gas_used * gas_price;
    let priority_fee = transaction.max_priority_fee();
    base_fee + priority_fee
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Staking Mechanism

Validator staking follows these principles:

- **Minimum Stake**: Minimum required stake for validator participation
- **Delegation**: Token holders can delegate stake to validators
- **Rewards**: Proportional rewards based on stake and performance
- **Slashing**: Penalties for protocol violations or poor performance

### 3.2 Governance Model

#### 3.2.1 On-Chain Governance

Governance decisions are made through on-chain voting:

- **Proposal Submission**: Stakeholders can submit governance proposals
- **Voting Period**: Time-bounded voting on active proposals
- **Execution**: Automatic execution of approved proposals
- **Veto Rights**: Emergency veto mechanisms for critical issues

#### 3.2.2 Parameter Management

Key network parameters can be adjusted through governance:

- **Gas Prices**: Base gas price and fee structure
- **Block Parameters**: Block size, time, and transaction limits
- **Staking Parameters**: Minimum stake, reward rates, slashing conditions
- **Network Configuration**: Validator set size, consensus timeouts
