          Gives an estimate of the gas unit price required to get a transaction
          on chain in a

          reasonable amount of time. The gas unit price is the amount that each
          transaction commits to

          pay for each unit of gas consumed in executing the transaction. The
          estimate is based on

          recent history: it gives the minimum gas that would have been required
          to get into recent

          blocks, for blocks that were full. (When blocks are not full, the
          estimate will match the

          minimum gas unit price.)


          The estimation is given in three values: de-prioritized (low),
          regular, and prioritized

          (aggressive). Using a more aggressive value increases the likelihood
          that the transaction

          will make it into the next block; more aggressive values are computed
          with a larger history

          and higher percentile statistics. More details are in AIP-34.
