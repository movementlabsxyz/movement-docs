          The output of the transaction will have the exact transaction outputs
          and events that running

          an actual signed transaction would have.  However, it will not have
          the associated state

          hashes, as they are not updated in storage.  This can be used to
          estimate the maximum gas

          units for a submitted transaction.


          To use this, you must:

          - Create a SignedTransaction with a zero-padded signature.

          - Submit a SubmitTransactionRequest containing a
          UserTransactionRequest containing that signature.


          To use this endpoint with BCS, you must submit a SignedTransaction

          encoded as BCS. See SignedTransaction in types/src/transaction/mod.rs.
