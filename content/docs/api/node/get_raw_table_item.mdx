          Get a table item at a specific ledger version from the table
          identified by {table_handle}

          in the path and the "key" (RawTableItemRequest) provided in the
          request body.


          The `get_raw_table_item` requires only a serialized key comparing to
          the full move type information

          comparing to the `get_table_item` api, and can only return the query
          in the bcs format.


          The Aptos nodes prune account state history, via a configurable time
          window.

          If the requested ledger version has been pruned, the server responds
          with a 410.
