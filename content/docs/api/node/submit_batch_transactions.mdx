          This allows you to submit multiple transactions.  The response has
          three outcomes:


          1. All transactions succeed, and it will return a 202

          2. Some transactions succeed, and it will return the failed
          transactions and a 206

          3. No transactions succeed, and it will also return the failed
          transactions and a 206


          To submit a transaction as JSON, you must submit a
          SubmitTransactionRequest.

          To build this request, do the following:


          1. Encode the transaction as BCS. If you are using a language that has

          native BCS support, make sure to use that library. If not, you may
          take

          advantage of /transactions/encode_submission. When using this

          endpoint, make sure you trust the node you're talking to, as it is

          possible they could manipulate your request.

          2. Sign the encoded transaction and use it to create a
          TransactionSignature.

          3. Submit the request. Make sure to use the "application/json"
          Content-Type.


          To submit a transaction as BCS, you must submit a SignedTransaction

          encoded as BCS. See SignedTransaction in types/src/transaction/mod.rs.

          Make sure to use the `application/x-bcs` Content-Type.
