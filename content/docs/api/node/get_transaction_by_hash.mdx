          Look up a transaction by its hash. This is the same hash that is
          returned

          by the API when submitting a transaction (see PendingTransaction).


          When given a transaction hash, the server first looks for the
          transaction

          in storage (on-chain, committed). If no on-chain transaction is found,
          it

          looks the transaction up by hash in the mempool (pending, not yet
          committed).


          To create a transaction hash by yourself, do the following:

          1. Hash message bytes: "RawTransaction" bytes + BCS bytes of
          [Transaction](https://aptos-labs.github.io/aptos-core/aptos_types/transaction/enum.Transaction.html).

          2. Apply hash algorithm `SHA3-256` to the hash message bytes.

          3. Hex-encode the hash bytes with `0x` prefix.
