          This endpoint allows you to get the transactions in a block

          and the corresponding block information given a version in the block.


          Transactions are limited by max default transactions size.  If not all
          transactions

          are present, the user will need to query for the rest of the
          transactions via the

          get transactions API.


          If the block has been pruned, it will return a 410
