          Get a table item at a specific ledger version from the table
          identified by {table_handle}

          in the path and the "key" (TableItemRequest) provided in the request
          body.


          This is a POST endpoint because the "key" for requesting a specific

          table item (TableItemRequest) could be quite complex, as each of its

          fields could themselves be composed of other structs. This makes it

          impractical to express using query params, meaning GET isn't an
          option.


          The Aptos nodes prune account state history, via a configurable time
          window.

          If the requested ledger version has been pruned, the server responds
          with a 410.
