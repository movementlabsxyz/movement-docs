          Same as /transactions/by_hash, but will wait for a pending transaction
          to be committed. To be used as a long

          poll optimization by clients, to reduce latency caused by polling. The
          "long" poll is generally a second or

          less but dictated by the server; the client must deal with the result
          as if the request was a normal

          /transactions/by_hash request, e.g., by retrying if the transaction is
          pending.
